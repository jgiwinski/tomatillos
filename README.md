### In this React Router Application, the User is able to browse a movie catalog using the display and search bar to filter movies.

#### 3. At any time in your search the back arrow is available as well as a Home button to fully reset your movie inquiry.

### We learned a great deal about some new technologies and ideals:
  1.  Cypress testing 
  2.  BrowerRouter from react-dom
  3.  Dynamic State and staticity

"We set out to enjoy the experience of approaching react cautiously enough to have fun doing it and in doing so, garner strength in the fundamentals of component lifecycle, property, and state. Being new to React Router 5, this has been a big leap in our progression as product developers.  Working to produce dynamic lifestyle-related rendering with components has been very eye-opening.  We now know when state is necessary and how to efficiently work with prototypes of our properties.  We also used Cypress testing and implemented fixtures to intercept requests.  This is a huge win for stubbing potential response errors and for testing in the field without racking up fees on the job."  -Chuck
