### In this React Router Application, the User is able to browse a movie catalog using the display and search bar to filter movies. 

### Actions
#### Browse from the Main Screen
#### Click on the movie you would like to see all the details for. You are now being routed to a url that has the movie's tagline and description, release and budget details, earnings and duration.  
#### At any time in your search the back arrow is available as well as a Home button to fully reset your movie inquiry.

### We learned a great deal about some new technologies and ideals:
  1.  Cypress testing 
  2.  BrowerRouter from react-dom
  3.  Dynamic State and staticity
